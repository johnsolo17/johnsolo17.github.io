          <li>All of the musicians interviewed had experienced times when they finished a performance and never received payment for it.</li>
          <li>Musicians experienced arriving for shows without knowing what equipment was being provided</li>
          <li>Musicians sometimes needed to know upfront about load in and stage times in order to determine if a certain gig was feasible.</li>
          <li>Venue operators had multiple job responsibilities and expressed frustration with the amount of back and forth required to book musicians for a show</li>
          <li>Venue operators had frustrations with musicians who did not show professionalism about the gig, either by getting drunk or by not adapting their show to the needs of the venue and audience.</li>

      <p>WeGig brought them together and solved both problems. There is room for improvement, but we had a good foundation that was based on the results of our interviews and surveys.</p>

  <p>A surprising number of ideas came out of our research, and narrowing it down to the main few was a difficult task. As shown here, some of the main features we agreed were most important were reviews, ease of access to information, contracts, estimates, and a couple of others.</p>
